# Pokedex App
Full Stack Development: Project One 

## Description
A simple Pokemon app written primarily in vanilla JavaScript with some JQuery. It uses the API from:

`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=500`

The app displays a list of the first 500 Pokemon in the database. The user can search Pokemon by name and click on each Pokemon to open a modal that displays more information.
